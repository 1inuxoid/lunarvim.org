# Colorscheme

## Switching colors

To switch color schemes on the fly, type the following command:

``` vim
:Telescope colorscheme
```

You can also press `Space` `s` `p` to cycle through colorschemes with a preview. 

To change the color scheme permanently, modify `lv-config.lua`

``` lua
lvim.colorscheme = 'desert'
```

You can add any colorscheme you like.  Just add a plugin with the colorscheme of your choice.  For more information on installing plugins [look here. ](../plugins/README.md)
