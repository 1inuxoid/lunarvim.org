# Languages

LunarVim strives to have basic LSP, linting, formatting and syntax support for all major languages.

If your language is not supported please do the following: 

- Check if LSP support is available in the lspconfig repo

- Check if your linter or formatter is available in the null-ls repo

- Check if your syntax is supported in the treesitter repo

If there is support for your language please file an issue with the LunarVim repo

If there is not file a ticket with one of the above repos
